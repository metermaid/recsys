I will be reviewing Youtube.com for this assignment. Youtube makes use of several recommenders that differ in personalization level. The two recommenders chosen will not require a Youtube account, but having a youtube account will allow you access to personalized recommenders based on previous viewing history and what your friends have viewed-- user-user algorithms. 

##Recommender 1: Youtube Homepage (no sign in)  
###Visit: http://www.youtube.com/ 

This recommender covers the domain of Online Videos, with the purpose to get people to watch these videos. (There is a recommender in the sidebar for recently popular channels, but that is not being covered.)The recommender is aggregated from other video viewers (Phoaks), with a context of time-- these are all popular videos from the past week. There is some geographic personalization based on these largely North American videos and a hockey video (I'm in Canada). Other countries will receive different videos. The privacy risk seems low-- these are just recently popular videos in my geographic area, presumably based on my IP address. Nobody's specific viewing habits have been revealed. The interface is simple, presenting videos from the past week sorted into Youtube's categories (music, entertainment, etc.) and popular channels. There is little to no explanation for why these are recommended. The recommendation algorithm seems to be a simple aggregation and business rules (selecting which categories and channels to highlight-- smosh is one of the biggest channels around.)

##Recommender 2: Video Page (No sign in)
###Visit: This recommender can be accessed at any page for a youtube video, for instance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560EpNc2rKg 

This recommender covers the domain of Online Videos, with the purpose to get people to watch these videos. (The ad is also likely recommended.)The recommender is aggregated from other Phoaks who have viewed the same video, in a product-associated recommendation context (videos being the product). The personalization is ephemeral-- it has been personalized based on the video you are watching right now. The privacy risk is low-- the information gathered is just the video you're watching at the moment. The interface is extremely minimal, presenting the videos recommended with no context except view count and creator (since these videos are largely from the same video producer) and view count (since these videos have been so popular, you might want to watch it as well.) The recommendation algorithm seems to be a aggregation of popular videos, as well as product-association (again, videos being the product.)
